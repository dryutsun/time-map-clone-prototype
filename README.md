I may need some sort of "project" table to store all related events togther, a one to many relationship


API utilized:
mapbox for interactive point detection/display?
I would ingest the APIS ability to get point information and ingest that information into my database along with other information.
I would also use the APIS ability to dispaly information

## SPRINT GOALS:

- [ ] 2021-11-11: At this point I would like to have my wireframes, ERD, Sprint Goals, MVP and Stretch goals all mapped out.
- [ ] 2021-11-12: At this point I would like to have my models and relationships created, I want to seed dummy data, and start/complete stubbing out my controllers/routes and views.
- [ ] 2021-11-13: At this point I want to start working with the mapbox api in order to get coordinate data and interactivity completed. 
- [ ] 2021-11-14: At this point I want to extend the views to display more pertinent data, i.e. timeline, modals.
- [ ] 2021-11-15: At this point, I would like to have interactivity functionality completed.

## MVP:
- [ ] I would like to have my models and route stubs created. Forms should display the correct information.
- [ ]  I would like the map to display the "event" on the map.
- [ ]  I would like some rudimentary time-related slider / timeline functionality.
- [ ]  Ideally, I would like for the user to be able to click on the screen and get lat-lon data for data entry. This should be put into the form.

"Project Routes":
- Main Page Should be an Index of All User Projects
- 

## OBSTACLES





## ROUTE ARCHITECTURE
- Main Index Page will be an index of all user projects
- If user clicks on a particular project they should be directed to a project page
	- This project page should have a form to enter in new data
	- When the user submits, it should refresh the page and display the new information
- If the user clicks on a certain marker, it should display some sort of modal data relating to the "title" "association" "entityid" "sourcedata" and "comments" OR If the user clicks on a certain maker, It should send the user to the page of that particular datapoint
- title
